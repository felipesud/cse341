# Project 2 Part 1 (CRUD Operations)

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to initiate the development of a new API and gain experience performing CRUD operations.

## Project Description
For Weeks 03-04, you will create a new project of your choosing within a two-week timeframe. This project involves performing CRUD operations on a MongoDB database, publishing it to the Web, incorporating security measures, and documenting the API.

## Project Specifics
This project is a quiz tailored for programming students. It includes 10 questions about C# and 10 questions about TypeScript, designed to test and evaluate students' knowledge as they advance in their studies.

## Overall Requirements (Due at the end of Week 04)
The requirements for this project (to be completed in Week 04) are as follows:
- The database should store at least two collections.
- One collection should contain documents with 7 fields or more.
- Successful connection of the Node project to MongoDB.
- Functional API routes for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.
- Data validation and error handling for all routes.
- Integration of OAuth for user management.
- Professional, comprehensive, relevant, and accurate API documentation.
- Publishing the API to Render and ensuring its accessibility from external sources.
- A 1-minute YouTube video demonstrating each API route in API documentation and showcasing modifications in the database.

## Part 1 Requirements (Due at the end of Week 03)
For this week's assignment (Week 03), complete the Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations with validation and error handling.

## Getting Started
To begin the project:
- Create a new Node.js project.
- Utilize the same MongoDB cluster/account, creating a new database for this project.
- Establish the initial REST API routes (similar to the previous Contacts project) including GET and POST requests.

## Adding Documentation and Publishing the API
Proceed with:
- Creating API documentation for the existing routes and performing tests.
- Setting up a new Render project.
- Securing MongoDB credentials in an env file and adding config vars to the Render project.

## Implementing Update, Delete Functionality, and Validation
Enhance the API by:
- Adding PUT and DELETE routes and validating their functionality in MongoDB.
- Integrating validation and error handling into the routes.
- Updating the API documentation to reflect all modifications.
