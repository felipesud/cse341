# Week 03 Team Activity: Validation and Error handling

## Overview
In this team activity for CSE 341: Web Services, the objective was to gain hands-on experience with Mongoose, a popular framework used in conjunction with MongoDB. The team's assignment involved working with a comprehensive RESTful API that integrates MongoDB and Mongoose.

### Task Description
- **MongoDB Setup**: A team member was designated to set up the MongoDB connection for the project.
- **Discussion on Validation and Error Handling**: As a group, discussions were held to identify potential areas for implementing validation checks and error handling mechanisms within the API.
- **Implementing Validation and Error Handling**: Each route of the API was augmented with appropriate validation checks and error handling procedures.
- **Testing Routes**: Utilization of a REST client to continuously test and validate the functionality of the routes as the implementation progressed.
- **Comparison with Sample Solution**: After completing the tasks, the team reviewed and compared their approach to a sample solution provided.
- **Submission**: Reporting participation in this activity via the I-Learn quiz.

## Steps Taken
1. **MongoDB Connection Setup**: A team member configured the connection to the MongoDB database.
2. **Group Discussion on Validation and Error Handling**:
   - Identified potential validation checkpoints for inputs and outputs.
   - Outlined strategies for error handling in various scenarios.
3. **Augmenting Routes**:
   - Added validation checks to ensure data integrity and correctness.
   - Implemented error handling procedures for different scenarios that could arise during API usage.
4. **Continuous Testing**:
   - Used a REST client to test each route, ensuring they functioned as intended.
   - Iteratively refined validation and error handling based on testing outcomes.
5. **Comparing Approaches**:
   - Reviewed the sample solution provided to analyze similarities and differences in the team's approach.
6. **Submission**:
   - Members reported participation in the activity by completing the I-Learn quiz.
