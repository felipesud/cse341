# Project 2 (CRUD Operations & Authentication)

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive API, implement CRUD operations, and integrate an authentication system using OAuth.

## Project Description
This project involves creating an API that facilitates CRUD operations on a MongoDB database and incorporates security measures through OAuth. The API is tailored as a quiz for programming students, covering questions on C# and TypeScript.

## Project Specifics
- The quiz consists of 10 questions for both C# and TypeScript, designed to evaluate students' programming knowledge.
- The system ensures data storage and retrieval for at least two collections in the MongoDB database.
- CRUD operations are implemented with error handling and data validation.
- OAuth is integrated to manage user authentication and access control.

## Overall Requirements (Completed by end of Week 04)
- MongoDB database with multiple collections and documents containing 7 fields or more.
- Functional API routes for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- Data validation and robust error handling across all routes.
- Integration of OAuth for user authentication and access control.
- Comprehensive and accurate API documentation.
- Publishing the API to Render for external accessibility.
- A 1-minute YouTube video demonstrating API routes and database modifications.

## Part 1 Requirements (Completed by end of Week 03)
- Implemented Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations with validation and error handling.

## Part 2 Requirements (Completed by end of Week 04)
- Implemented OAuth-based authentication.
- Added user account creation, login, logout functionalities.
- Secured routes to restrict access based on authentication.
- Utilized bcrypt for password hashing, ensuring enhanced security for user credentials.
- Updated Swagger documentation to reflect the added security measures.

## Getting Started
To begin the project:
- Create a Node.js project.
- Set up a MongoDB cluster and create a new database for the project.
- Establish initial REST API routes for GET and POST requests.

## Adding Documentation and Publishing the API
Proceed with:
- Creating comprehensive API documentation covering all implemented routes.
- Setting up a Render project for publishing the API.
- Securing MongoDB credentials using environment variables and configuring Render project variables.

## Implementing Update, Delete Functionality, and Validation
Enhance the API by:
- Adding PUT and DELETE routes with MongoDB validation.
- Integrating data validation and error handling across all routes.
- Updating API documentation to reflect all modifications.

## Implementing Authentication (Part 2)
Finish the project by:
- Incorporating OAuth-based authentication system.
- Allowing user account creation, login, and logout functionalities.
- Restricting access to certain routes based on authentication status.
- Ensuring bcrypt hashing for secure storage of user credentials.
- Updating Swagger documentation to showcase the implemented security measures.
