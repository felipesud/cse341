# CSE341 - Web Services

## Course Description
This course focuses on the backend development of dynamic, service-oriented web applications. Students learn how to design and implement web services, interact with data storage, and use these tools to build functioning web applications.

## Technologies Used
We are using **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Express** for task implementation. 

## Installation
To test the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. Node.js
2. MongoDB
3. Express

You can install them using npm (Node Package Manager):

\`\`\`bash
npm install express mongodb
\`\`\`

## Repository Structure
Each task is located in a specific branch following the pattern \`week<Week Number>/<Task Type>\`. For example, the individual activity for week 1 is in the branch \`week01/individual-activity\`.

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
1. Understand the difference between server-side rendering and REST APIs and how to implement them.
2. Incorporate a secure authentication system in a web application that traverses the full stack.
3. Deploy a full stack application to the web.
4. Develop, document and deploy a secure REST API that performs CRUD operations on a NoSQL database.
5. Effectively contribute to a team while learning independently.

This course is part of the curriculum at BYU Idaho in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
